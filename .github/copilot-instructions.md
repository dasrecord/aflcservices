# AFLC Services - Counselling Website

This is a Vue.js counselling and therapy website built with Vite. The project focuses on creating a professional, accessible, and compassionate online presence for mental health services.

## Project Guidelines

### Design Principles

- **Accessibility First**: Ensure all components are accessible with proper ARIA labels, focus management, and keyboard navigation
- **Professional & Calming**: Use calming colors (purples, soft blues) and clean typography
- **Mobile-First**: All components should be responsive and work well on mobile devices
- **Performance**: Optimize for fast loading times and smooth animations

### Component Structure

- Use Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>`
- Create reusable, well-documented components
- Follow semantic HTML structure
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts

### Styling Conventions

- Use scoped styles in components
- Follow the established color scheme: Primary (#6a4c93), Secondary (#553a7a), Accent (#ffd700)
- Maintain consistent spacing using multiples of 1rem
- Use CSS custom properties for theme colors

### Content Guidelines

- Keep mental health and counselling context in mind
- Use compassionate, professional language
- Ensure all content is trauma-informed and inclusive
- Include appropriate disclaimers for mental health services

### Technical Considerations

- Prioritize user privacy and data security
- Implement proper form validation
- Use semantic HTML for better SEO
- Ensure fast loading times and optimized images

### Accessibility Requirements

- Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
- Alt text for all images
- Focus indicators for interactive elements
- Screen reader friendly content structure

When making suggestions or writing code, always consider the sensitive nature of mental health services and prioritize user trust, safety, and accessibility.
